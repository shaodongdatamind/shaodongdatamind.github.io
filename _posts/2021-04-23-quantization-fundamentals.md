This is a learning notes of the online course Quantization Fundamentals with Hugging Face (https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/quantization-fundamentals-with-hugging-face/).

The current model compression methods include pruning, knowledge distillation, and  quantization. 
-	Pruning: simply remove layers in a model that do not have much importance on the modelâ€™s decisions. The removing strategy is based on some metrics, like the magnitudes of the weights.
-	Knowledge distillation: train a student model, which is the target-compressed model using  the output from the teacher model in addition to the main loss term.
-	Quantization: represent model weights in a lower precision. Note we can either quantize the model weights and the activations (i.e. output of layers). 

## Dtype casting
Module casting in pytorch
```python
target_dtype = torch.float16 # torch.bfloat16
model = model.to(target_dtype)
model = model.half() # float16
model = model.bfloat16() # bfloat16
torch.set_default_dtype(desired_dtype)
```
Module casting in huggingface
```python
model_bf16 = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
```

Note that most LLM models are float32. If we quantize to float16, sometimes weights may be out of the range of the float16 (overflow). In this case, we need to quantize the model to bfloat16. bfloat16 has the same range as the float32, but less precision. 

## Linear Quantization
Linear quantization involves mapping floating point values to integers using a linear transformation characterized by a scale factor (s) and sometimes a zero-point (z), which adjusts for the offset.

The quantization process can be expressed as: r=s(q-z)
where 
- r is the original value (e.g. FP32), 
- q is the quantized value (e.g. INT8), 
- s is the scale factor (e.g. FP32), and 
- z is the zero-point (e.g. INT8).

This process is reversable, so that we can approximately convert back from the quantized integer value to the original value. 


## Quantization toolkit library from HuggingFace
Load model:
```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
```
Quantize the model:
```python
from quanto import quantize, freeze
quantize(model, weights=torch.int8, activations=None)
freeze(model)
```
Run inference:
```python
input_text = "Hello, my name is "
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
outputs = model.generate(input_ids)
```

## Quantization Aware Training
Quantization Aware Training (QAT) is a technique used to mitigate the negative effects that can arise from quantizing a model, such as loss of accuracy. QAT simulates the effects of quantization during the training process. It trains the model in a way that controls how the model performs once it is quantized. 
-	During forward pass (inference), we use the quantized version of model weights to make predictions. 
-	During back propagation (updating model weights), we update original, unquantized version of model weights.
